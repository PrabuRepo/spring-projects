/* What is Dynamic Programming?
 * Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems 
 * and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.
 * 
 * Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving 
 * each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map,etc). Each of the 
 * subproblem solutions is indexed in some way, typically based on the values of its input parameters, so as to facilitate its lookup. 
 * So the next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, 
 * thereby saving computation time. This technique of storing solutions to subproblems instead of recomputing them is called memoization.
 * 
 * DP Quote: "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" 
 * 
 * Characteristics of Dynamic Programming:
 * 	1.Optimal Substructure Property - Use sub problems: Any problem has optimal substructure property if its overall optimal solution can 
 * 	  be constructed from the optimal solutions of its subproblems.   
 * 	2.Overlapping Subproblems - Reuse sub problems: Subproblems are smaller versions of the original problem. Any problem has overlapping 
 *    sub-problems if finding its solution involves solving the same subproblem multiple times. 
 *      Eg: Fibonacci numbers, as we know, Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2). This clearly shows that a problem of size ‘n’ has been reduced
 *      to subproblems of size ‘n-1’ and ‘n-2’. Therefore, Fibonacci numbers have optimal substructure property.
 *   
 * DP offers two methods to solve a problem:
 * 1.Top-down with Memoization: 
 * 	 In this approach, we try to solve the bigger problem by recursively finding the solution to smaller 
 * 	 sub-problems. Whenever we solve a sub-problem, we cache its result so that we don’t end up solving it repeatedly if it’s called 
 *   multiple times. Instead, we can just return the saved result. This technique of storing the results of already solved subproblems
 *   is called Memoization.
 * 2.Bottom-up with Tabulation:
 * 	 Tabulation is the opposite of the top-down approach and avoids recursion. In this approach, we solve the problem “bottom-up” 
 *   (i.e. by solving all the related sub-problems first). This is typically done by filling up an n-dimensional table. Based on the 
 *   results in the table, the solution to the top/original problem is then computed. 
 *   Tabulation is the opposite of Memoization, as in Memoization we solve the problem and maintain a map of already solved sub-problems.
 *   In other words, in memoization, we do it top-down in the sense that we solve the top problem first (which typically recurses down to 
 *   solve the sub-problems).    
 *
 * All the DP problems are solved in following 3 approaches such as,
 *    1.Recursion -  Time: exponential time O(2^n), space complexity is O(n) which is used to store the recursion stack.
 *    2.DP: Top Down Approach or Memoization - Time and space complexity is equal to memoization array size. Mostly this approach takes 
 *    										   same Time & Space complexity as Bottom up approach. 
 *    3.DP: Bottom Up Approach or Tabulation - Time & space complexity is O(n^2) or O(n)
 *    
 * Imp Note: All the recursion problems needs below two points
 * 		1. Base case -> Its common for Recursion solution, memoization and bottom up approach
 * 		2. Recursive function(Sub problems + Relationship between sub problems)
